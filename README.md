# saeparized color theme

This is a color theme derived from my day to day terminal colors. As the vim
color plugin was derived from the solarized color scheme, which I used for
quite some time, I kind of named it after that.

As I keep finding some annoyances with some markings that are not visible in
the preview direclty, this theme still is a moving target. Feel free to leave
any change requests in the issue tracker.

that use their own definitons.
